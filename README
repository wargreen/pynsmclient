[Purpose]
Python nsmclient is a convenience wrapper around liblo and NSM-OSC
syntax to implement Non Session support easily in your own Python
programs.
You don't need any OSC knowledge to use this package.

[Instructions]
Copy nsmclient.py into your source directory or use
    python3 setup.py install
to install nsmclient.py system-wide. Both variants are equally good.
Just copying it to your own source tree does not require your users
to install nsmclient themselves. Since this is a really small lib I
recommend this approach.

 In your own program:
    import nsmclient

Then call nsmclient.init() with the correct parameters.
Please see example.py, a well documented, minimal and working example.
Only 30 lines of code.

The important part is that your application follows the NSM rules
(see example.py documentation and nsm website http://non.tuxfamily.org/nsm/API.html)
